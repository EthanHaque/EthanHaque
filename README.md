### Hey there, I'm Ethan ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ethan Haque, and I am a senior at the Illinois Mathematics and Science academy. 
I am an aspiring software-engineer/medical-doctor combo, and I am passionate about making free, open-source
software.
<br>
<br>
I've done a little bit of everything from [full-stack web development](https://otsdaq.fnal.gov/tutorials_v2/) (ask me about this!) to
teaching from-scratch courses on [machine learning](https://github.com/EthanHaque/neural-networks-class) to creating highly stable plant 
[protein variants](https://digitalcommons.imsa.edu/sir_presentations/2020/session2/57/) to combat climate change.
